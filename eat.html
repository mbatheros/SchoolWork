			We love our food in Kenya. When you visit you of course have the option of staying at a five-star hotel (we have plenty of those) where you will be fed food with fancy names like filet mignon, shrimp with angel hair, Cajun jambalaya pasta and the likes. You also have the option of doing it the Kenyan way. Why spend so much of your money travelling to a foreign country only to feel like you were back at home? Might as well have stayed at home and gone to cheesecake factory instead and save yourself a lot of money. Among the places you can visit are the carnivore restaurant. Here you can eat any kind of game meat that you can think of. Lion, buffalo, zebra, crocodile hippopotamus, rhino…any game found in Kenya has its meat available here.  
			Skip the luxury restaurant and go to the heart of Nairobi city. Here you will find the local restaurants called vibanda. These are mainly family owned has I can attest to the fact that they have the tastiest food I have ever tasted anywhere. I meant that.</p>
			
			<h4>Eating etiquette.</h4>
			Kenyans eat most of their food with bare hands. Dishes like Ugali, nyamachoma (barbeque meat) chapati are eaten that way. Even in a restaurant someone will come with a jug of warm water and soap and wash your hands before a meal. If you are in the company of other Kenyans, chances are that someone will give a thanksgiving prayer before the meal. Eating even in fancy restaurants is very informal and no need to worry about what fork or spoon should be used for what meal. Talking during meals is not only permitted but encouraged. After the meal someone will come again and wash your hands just as before with warm water and soap

			<h4>Here is a possible menu</h4>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Githeri</th>
					<td>This is an ethnic staple food of Kenya. It is made by boiling corn and beans till they are palatable then frying them with onions tomatoes and varying assortment of vegetables and spices. As a tourist it might be a bit rough on your tummy the first time but within no time you will be craving for it.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Ugali</th>
					<td>Now after trying this you might call me nuts for even recommending it. This is because there is really nothing remarkable about Ugali. It has a bland taste, white in color and a very mild aroma. But Ugali is eaten daily by almost 90% of the Kenyan population. It is a dish made of white corn flour mixed in boiling water till hard. When cooking the cook with tear off a bit of ugali from the pot and toss it at the wall. If it is ready then the piece will fall off the wall, but if it’s not ready it will get stuck on the wall and that means more stirring is required.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Chapati</th>
					<td>This is a meal that has been borrowed partly from Indians and from the Arabs. (Kenyan population is 8% Indians and 5% coastal Arabs) It is a bread like meal made of wheat flour dough shallow fried akin to the Indian naan or Arab Chapatti.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Mukimo</th>
					<td>This is a dish indigenous to the Kikuyu tribe of Kenya. It is mashed potatoes mixed with vegetables.</td>
				</tr>
