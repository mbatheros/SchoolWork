			<p>
			Kenya is home to a wide variety of treasured species in national parks and reserves, including lions, black rhinos, ostriches, hippos, buffalos, giraffe and zebra. Last year in the country 69 elephants – out of a population of 34,000 - and nine rhinos – from a population of under 1,000 - were killed. Because of this Kenya has adopted a zero tolerance policy againist poaching. You could face the death penalty or a life sentence if found guilty of poaching or trading in poached items.  For years, many people angry at high levels of poaching, linked with lucrative organised crime, have called for the death sentence as a deterrent. Gangs sell elephant tusks for ivory in the far East, where it is turned into trinkets; rhino horn is believed by some wealthy buyers there to serve as a medicine – even though it is made of keratin, the same substance as human fingernails, so has no health-giving properties
